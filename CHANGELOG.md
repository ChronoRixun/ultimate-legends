# Changelog

The launcher's version comes from its release tag (`v0.3.2`): premake reads it with `git describe` when it
generates the project, so a release only needs this entry and the tag.

## 0.3.2 (unreleased)

### Added
- **Test mode for X-Men Legends (Legends Classic port), for testers.** A Test mode section on the port's page
  switches the XML2 Fix's `[TestMode]` keys in the port's `xml2-fix.ini`, so nobody has to edit the file by hand
  (on a Steam Deck, say):
  - **Forge at every Xtraction point** (`ForgeEverywhere`) and **Test hotkeys F8/F9/F10** (`Hotkeys`), off by
    default. Each toggle writes its own key, as `1` or `0`, and nothing else: every other key and section of the
    file (the builder's `[Game]` / `[Limits]` / `[Online]`, the player's `[Display]` / `[Discord]`) stays byte for
    byte, comments included.
  - While either is on, the XML2 Fix turns online play off; the section says so, and a **Test mode on** badge
    under Play shows it, with **Turn test mode off**.
  - The game reads the keys when it starts. They need XML2 Fix 1.6.0 or later; with an older fix in the folder,
    the section says the switches are ignored.
  - The toggles are buttons the keyboard reaches (Tab, then Enter or Space), with a visible focus ring, so a
    controller mapped to the keyboard, a touchscreen or a mouse all work.
  - Nothing is written while a build runs in the folder. Rebuild, Repair, Verify Files and the XML2 Fix update
    before a build keep the keys; Uninstall deletes `xml2-fix.ini`, test mode with it, as before.
